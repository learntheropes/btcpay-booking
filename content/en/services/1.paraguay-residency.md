I'm here to share my 6 years of **permanent residency in Paraguay** and managing **companies in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada**.

The combination of these is the ideal and unrepeatable situation for digital nomads as:

- Allows **0% taxation** for both the company and the person.

- The only requirement to maintain the status is to stay in Paraguay for **3 days every 3 years**. You can therefore **spend your time where you prefer**.

- An **investment is not required** other than the fees of the Paraguayan and Canadian professional to initiate and maintain all the required declarations in order.

- Reduced costs: around 3000 euros to take up permanent residence and open the company and around 300 usd per year for the personal and corporate declaration in subsequent years.

- Paraguay is one of the very few countries with **territorial taxation not black listed** in Italy and EU, making the process of registering and maintaining AIRE much easier than in other 'tax havens'.

- The countries mentioned for the opening of the company do not appear as tax havens and are prestigious jurisdictions, making an excellent impression in the eyes of your customers.

If you want to learn more about all the aspects that I have gained in my 5 years of experience, where I will be able to explain the timing and documents required for residence, the documents and requirements for the company, the banking solutions and payment systems available and much more, book the your advice.
